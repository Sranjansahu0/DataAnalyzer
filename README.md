# DataAnalyzer
• Developed a Data Analyzer Web App with FastAPI and Streamlit to upload and analyze structured datasets dynamically.
• Implemented statistical computations (mean, median, variance, standard deviation, min/max) using NumPy and Pandas.
• Added missing value detection and automated summarization of dataset quality.
• Built a correlation matrix engine with numeric filtering and visual exploration through Heatmap and Scatter Plot.
• Designed interactive UI elements (dropdowns, tables, visual graphs) to support intuitive data exploration for end-users.
• Utilized Pydantic models for request validation and secure JSON data exchange between frontend and backend.


Note Before Run: 
<br>
Sample CSV file is avaiable in git repo, to download and test. Path - employee_data.csv <br>
As backend is deployed on Render(Free version), very first time it will take a bit longer, so need to wait for few minute <br>
